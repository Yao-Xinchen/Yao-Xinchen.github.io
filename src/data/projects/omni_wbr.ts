			content: `	Wheeled-biped robots combine the energy efficiency and speed of wheeled locomotion with the terrain adaptability of legged systems, making them ideal for applications like delivery, inspection, and rescue. However, existing control methods face critical limitations:
1. Model-based approaches rely on simplified dynamics and non-holonomic constraints that restrict omnidirectional mobility and terrain adaptability, essentially reducing the robot to a "Segway with legs"
2. Existing RL-based methods remain constrained to forward motion with explicit mode switching, lacking true omnidirectional mobility and adaptive hybrid locomotion
3. The potential of the wheeled-biped structure for adaptive hybrid locomotion across diverse terrains remains largely unexploited`,
